Have you ever wondered what to do with your waste 0% uranium?  
Worry no more! Now you can use it to make tools and armor.  
Tools are fast and deal a lot of damage, armor also provides radiation protection.  

__NEW FEATURES__
 * Tools will now irradiate mobs to drain their health over time.
 * Armor will drain your health if the "Uranium Protection Gem" is not in your inventory.
 * Uranium tool in hand will now also drain your health without the gem
 * Irradiated mobs have a radioactive green glow
 * Most settings can be configured

If the technic mod is not present, this mod will provide uranium ore generation.  
Uranium ore will be found at the same heights as with technic, but at much lower quantities,  
to compensate for the lack of need for centrifuging.
