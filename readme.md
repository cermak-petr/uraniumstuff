Have you ever wondered what to do with your waste 0% uranium?  
Worry no more! Now you can use it to make tools and armor.  
Tools are fast and deal a lot of damage, armor also provides radiation protection.  

If the technic mod is not present, this mod will provide uranium ore generation.  
Uranium ore will be found at the same heights as with technic, but at much lower quantities,  
to compensate for the lack of need for centrifuging.  

Tools added:
Uranium Sword  
Uranium Axe  
Uranium Shovel  
Uranium Pickaxe  
Uranium Hoe  
Uranium Multitool  
    
Armor added:
Uranium Chestplate  
Uranium Leggings  
Uranium Boots  
Uranium Helmet  
Uranium Shield
